I took the opportunity of a lab meeting to create my professional website. And I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I like the idea that I can use Markdown to author my posts. The [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) says it's easy and I want to believe it is. If this is the only note you'll see, that would probably mean that I failed - or that I was not ready to bring contents to my website, which as likely.
